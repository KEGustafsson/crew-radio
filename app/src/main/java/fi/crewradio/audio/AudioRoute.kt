/**
 * Where the voice goes: a Bluetooth headset over SCO when one is connected, a wired or USB
 * headset when plugged in, otherwise the speakerphone. Follows headsets as they come and
 * go while the session lasts, and reports each change on the status line.
 *
 * VOICE_COMMUNICATION capture and playback follow the "communication device", so both the
 * mic and the ear end up on the headset. API 31+ has [AudioManager.setCommunicationDevice]
 * for that; older phones get the same through speakerphone and SCO switches.
 *
 * While a Bluetooth headset is present the engine hands routing to Telecom (see
 * `CallService`), which owns the route for as long as that call lasts; this class then
 * goes [passive] and only carries the label. [onBluetoothHeadset] tells the engine when to
 * start and end that call.
 *
 * A headset's SCO link is narrow: 8 or 16 kHz mono, so it carries this app's 16 kHz voice as it is.
